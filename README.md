Code to post-process a binary predictor to satisfy approximate counterfactual equalized odds (counterfactualEO).

The python code can be installed as a package by, for example, running "pip install ." from inside the top level Post-Processed-Fair-Predictors directory.

The Jupyter notebook post_processed_fair_predictors.ipynb is for generating simulations.
The Jupyter notebook real_data_analysis.ipynb is for analyzing the COMPAS data and the child welfare data.
