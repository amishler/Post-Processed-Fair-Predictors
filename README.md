Post-Processed-Fair-Predictors

Code to post-process a binary predictor to satisfy approximate counterfactual equalized odds (counterfactualEO).
The python code can be installed as a package by, for example, running "pip install -e ." from inside the top level counterfactualEO directory.

The Jupyter notebook accompanies a forthcoming paper (to be posted to Arxiv in August, 2020).
